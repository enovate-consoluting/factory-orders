# Factory Orders Project

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 15.5.6 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Vercel deployment

## Code Rules
1. NEVER remove existing functionality - only ADD
2. Every file needs header comment with name, description, roles, date
3. Always run `npm run build` before pushing to git
4. Ask before removing any code/imports
5. Preserve all existing props and interfaces
6. Use Windows commands (no rm, use del)
7. Use Propoer standard text not database tags (eg Sample Tech and not sampletech)
8. DEBUG displays (margins, prices, internal info) - SUPER ADMIN ONLY, never visible to manufacturers or clients

## User Roles
- super_admin: Full access, sees costs + client prices
- admin: Manage orders, sees client prices only
- manufacturer: Pricing, production, sees costs only
- client: View/approve orders

## Key Folders
- app/dashboard/orders/[id]/components/ - Order detail components
- app/dashboard/orders/shared-components/ - Shared components
- app/dashboard/orders/[id]/hooks/ - Custom hooks
- lib/ - Utilities and Supabase client

## When Modifying Files
- Don't rewrite entire files - make targeted changes
- Show what changed, not the whole file
- Test build locally before suggesting git push
